This is a credit risk model pertaining to retail loans.
Dataset contains over 800,000 rows, and the dataset's period ranges from 2007 to 2015.

The Dataset has numerous categorical and continuous variables which will be binned using the WoE (Weight of Evidence) and IV method.
This model's probability of default prediction will be built using Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Lastly, the model's validation will be tested using AUC-ROC curve as this is a largely imbalanced dataset. Hence, a normal accuracy TP FP test won't be an accurate assessment. 

I am building this model as a replica of my current work in my current company.
This work is still ongoing as I am building it after work / on my off days.
